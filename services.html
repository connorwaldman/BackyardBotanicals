        <h2>Design Consulatations</h4>
        <p>Consultations will take place at your home in your garden. We encourage clients to gather photographs of
          garden
          designs that appeal to them to give us an idea of their desired style. The consultation will take
          approximately
          1 ½-2
          hours. During this time, we will discuss your preferences in bloom colors, plant heights and amount of desired
          maintenance. We will walk the area, noting your existing landscape and any ideas you may have for changes or
          additions. We will discuss potential plant, tree and shrub species that could be included in a design drawing.
          As part
          of the consultation, we can mark the designed shapes of the garden beds with landscape flags as a visual aid.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you would like detailed drawings of the design ideas, we will photograph and measure the area during the
          design
          consultation. An estimate will be given at the time of the consultation for the cost of scaled design
          drawings.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="service-item si2">
        <div class="service-pic drawings"></div>

        <h2>Design Drawings</h2>
        <p>The design drawing allows for more thoughtful creativity in the design process. We will prepare a scaled
          drawing with
          plant, tree and shrub species selected for each area of the landscaping. If there is additional interest in
          hardscaping, raised beds, trellises or fencing, we will include design concepts with the drawings. After the
          drawings
          are complete, we will schedule an additional appointment with you to: 1) present the drawings with a slide
          show
          of the
          selected plants, trees and shrubs; 2) explain the estimate for the cost of the plant material, installation
          and
          seasonal maintenance; and 3) implement any changes to the drawings suggested by the client.

      <div class="service-item si3">
        <div class="service-pic installation"></div>

        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>The installation process includes any removal of existing landscaping, site preparation, and procurement and
          installation of plants, trees, and shrubs. Oversight for any contracted work such as hardscaping or carpentry
          is
          included in the installation process.
        </p>

      <div class="service-item si4">
        <div class="service-pic maitenance"></div>

        <h2>Maitenance</h2>
        <p>Maintenance can include mulching, weeding, pruning, dividing and transplanting perennials, and replacement
          planting.
          This can be scheduled on a weekly, monthly or seasonal basis based on the size of the garden and the client’s
          budget.
          We are always open to working alongside clients during the installation process or maintenance, as some
          clients
          are
          gardeners themselves or would like to learn more about gardening through the process.
