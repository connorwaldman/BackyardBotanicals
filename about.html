        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Backyard Botanicals is a small landscape design company that offers landscape design, plant
            procurement, installation and seasonal maintenance for residential and commercial properties.
            We specialize in the use of perennial plants, trees, and shrubs that are native to this region of
            Kentucky. Our designs are intuitive, vibrant and personalized. We have a deep passion for
            native plants and the healthy ecology of our community. It is our hope that through our work, we
            can share this passion with others by putting native plants in backyard gardens across the city.
            Whether you want to add to an existing garden or create a whole new look for your overall
            landscape, we can help you. If you are interested in talking to us about your project, we would
            love to hear from you.</p>

        <p>Elizabeth Kuhn is the owner of Backyard Botanicals. Her respect for the natural world inspires

            her commitment to explore and improve backyard ecology with native plants. Her background
            includes residential and commercial landscape design, plant propagation, greenhouse
            management, seed collection, food production, medicinal herbs, and wild edibles. With the
            destruction of many natural areas, Elizabeth believes that the use of native plants in a
            residential and commercial landscaping is a key component to sustaining our native populations
            of pollinators, birds and butterflies. It is Elizabeth's job to artfully and skillfully design a garden
            that is right for the homeowner (/customer?) and for the natural ecology of your backyard.
            Elizabeth offers workshops on a wide range of topics including gardening with natives, wild
            edibles, rain garden installation and seed collection for the backyard gardener.</p>
