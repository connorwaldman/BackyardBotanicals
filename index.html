      <h1>Backyard Botanicals</h1>
      <p>
        is a landscape design company offering landscape design, plant procurement, installation and
        seasonal maintenance for residential and commercial properties. We specialize in the use of perennial plants,
        trees and
        shrubs that are native to this region of Kentucky. Our designs are intuitive, vibrant and personalized. We have
        a deep
        passion for native plants and the healthy ecology of our community. It is our hope that through our work, we can
        share
        this passion with others by planting native plants in backyard gardens across the city.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whether you want to expand an existing garden or create a whole new look for your overall landscape, we can help
        you. If
        youâ€™re interested in talking to us about your project, we would love to hear from you!

        <h2>Elizabeth Kuhn</h2>
        <h5>Owner of Backyard Botanicals</h5>
        <p>Elizabeth Kuhn is committed to improving backyard ecology with
          native
          plants. Elizabeth's professional background includes residential and commercial landscape design, plant
          propagation,
          greenhouse management, seed collection, food production, medicinal herbs and wild edibles. She believes
          that the use
          of native plants in residential and commercial landscaping is key to sustaining our native populations
          of
          pollinators, birds and butterflies and serves as a counter-balance to the increasing destruction of many
          natural
          areas. It is Elizabeth's job to artfully and skillfully design a garden that is right for the client and
          for the
          natural ecology of your backyard.
          <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, Elizabeth offers workshops on a wide range of topics including gardening with natives,
          wild edibles, rain
          garden installation and seed collection for the backyard gardener.
          <br>
          <br>
          Backyard Botanicals is a fully licensed and insured women-owned business.
