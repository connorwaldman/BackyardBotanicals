        Backyard Botanicals is a landscape design company offering landscape design, plant procurement, installation and
        seasonal maintenance for residential and commercial properties. We specialize in the use of perennial plants, trees and
        shrubs that are native to this region of Kentucky. Our designs are intuitive, vibrant and personalized. We have a deep
        passion for native plants and the healthy ecology of our community. It is our hope that through our work, we can share
        this passion with others by planting native plants in backyard gardens across the city.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whether you want to expand an existing garden or create a whole new look for your overall landscape, we can help you. If
        you’re interested in talking to us about your project, we would love to hear from you!

      <h1>Why Native?</h1>
      <p>What is a native plant? “Native plants should be defined as those that have evolved and adapted to a specific
        location and have remained genetically unaltered by humans. “[1] As native plants evolve and adapt to a specific
        location, so does the wildlife, creating a symbiotic relationship that forms healthy local ecosystems.
        <br>
        <br>
        Among the many benefits of native plants are their adaptability to our climate and soil, their great performance in the
        garden without the need for pesticides or fertilizers, and, most importantly, the food and habitat they provide for our
        native pollinators, butterflies and birds.
        <br>
        <br>
        Native landscaping includes a wide variety of plant species to support and provide nutrients to a diverse array of
        pollinators, birds and butterflies. Many native pollinators and butterflies are referred to as “diet specialists” and
        can only feed on or pollinate one or several host plants. For example, there is a growing awareness of the crisis of the
        monarch butterfly caused by the destruction of habitat that once flourished with milkweed, their native host plant. Like
        the monarch butterfly, thousands of butterflies, moths, insects and birds have a similar symbiotic relationship with the
        plants, trees and shrubs native to our area.
        <br>
        <br>
        Pollinators, which includes bees, wasps, insects, moths and butterflies, require a diverse array of plant species that
        bloom throughout the season. Plants that produce pollen and nectar early in the season, like violets and woodland
        wildflowers, need to be included alongside summer and fall blooming plants, like coneflowers, asters and goldenrods. The
        inclusion of trees and shrubs provides early pollen with their blooms, attractive leaves for caterpillars, and edible
        fruit in the fall for our native birds. A backyard designed with true natives provides a healthy, nutritious habitat to
        our birds, bees, and butterflies. And for us, we get to enjoy the beauty and watch it all unfold.
